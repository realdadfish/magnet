/**
 * Magnet instantiates classes marked with this annotation automatically. Annotated
 * classes must have a single, none private constructor. Constructor is allowed to have
 * parameters which are dependencies for this instance. Magnet checks constructor
 * parameters and tries to resolve corresponding dependencies by looking into accessible
 * scopes. If no suitable instances were found in scopes, Magnet searches for
 * {@code Instance}-annotated classes and tried to instantiate them. If constructor's
 * dependencies cannot be fulfilled, Magnet will fail at runtime with corresponding
 * error message.
 *
 * <p>
 * In the example below we declare two dependent types and instantiate them in scope.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     &#64;Instance(type=TypeA.class)
 *     class TypeA {
 *         TypeA() {}
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;Instance(type=TypeB.class)
 *     class TypeB {
 *         final TypeA typeA;
 *         TypeB(@NonNull TypeA dependency) {
 *             typeA = dependency;
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     // get instance of typeB
 *     TypeB typeB = scope.getSingle(TypeB.class);
 *
 *     // typeA has been provided by Magnet
 *     typeB.typeA != null
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Nullability.</b> Magnet is capable of detecting whether dependency can or cannot be null.
 * If a constructor's parameter is annotated as nullable and Magnet cannot provide instance of
 * parameter's type, then <code>null</code> is provided instead.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Classification.</b> Same interface can be implemented by many classes. Classifier is used
 * to differentiate between those implementations. See {@link Classifier} for more detail.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Scoping.</b> Magnet can bind created instances into scope for reuse. Instance can
 * specify whether and how its instances should be bound into the scope. See {@link Scoping}
 * for more detail.
